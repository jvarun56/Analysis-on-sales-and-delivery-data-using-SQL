-- 8.	Retrieve month-by-month customer retention rate since the start of the business.(using views)
#1: Create a view where each userâ€™s visits are logged by month, allowing for the possibility that these will have 
#occurred over multiple # years since whenever business started operations
# 2: Identify the time lapse between each visit. So, for each person and for each month, we see when the next visit is.
# 3: Calculate the time gaps between visits
# 4: categorise the customer with time gap 1 as retained, >1 as irregular and NULL as churned
# 5: calculate the retention month wise
